### Course information

### Meeting times and purposes

After the first session, this course will be broken into "communities of interest." These communities should continue to meet during Wednesday and Friday class time to collaborate on weekly assignments and meet with the professor. You will be assigned to one of these groups based on responses to a survey distributed before the first day of the course. After that day, the following schedule takes effect:

|Day(s) of Week |Time           |Purpose                                |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
|Wednesday      |1:50 - 2:40 PM |Group meetings, discussion, activities |
|Friday         |1:50 - 2:40 PM |Open "drop-in"/workshop time           |

Occasionally, we will have a guest speaker. These visits will take place on Wednesdays and will be recorded for those folks who can't attend.

### Canonical course description

An introduction to the technical and communication skills needed to design, implement, and publicly release innovative software. In addition to establishing connections with professionals in the software feld, students refine their writing abilities as they participate in online technical communities. During a weekly practical session, students use state-of-the-art tools to complete well-documented software that is useful to external collaborators, describing their systems through oral presentations and written documents featured on a web site.

* Prerequisite knowledge: `CMPSC 101`
* Distribution requirements: `ME`,`SP`

### Less canonical, but still official, course description

Generally speaking, developers who are in charge of hiring decisions reduce how they make those decisions to two factors:

1. Communications skills
2. Development skills

And many report these two factors in that order. As Douglas Crockford, developer of the JSON format, discusses with author Peter Seibel in Coders at Work:

> Seibel: When you're hiring programmers, how do you reconize the good ones?
> ...
> Crockford: ...I'm looking for quality of presentation...how effectively they can communicate, that's a skill I'm hiring for....I would focus on the communication aspect.

So far, you've focused your academic career on acquiring the second of these two sets of skills. In CMPSC 480, we'll shift our awareness to the way in which these skills interact and how writing and talking about your relationship to your development projects provides clarity for what we mean
when we say "innovation."

As a 2017 report by David J. Deming for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) points out, the "unusual combination" of technical and so-called "soft" skills enjoys substantial currency. Most importantly, as author Austin Kleon reminds us, "[y]our work doesn't exist in a vacuum...[w]hether you realize it or not, you're already telling a story about [it]." It is this story where, as Henry Doss points out, innovation begins. Despite your trajectory--whether aiming for a career or graduate school--the world is interested in how you tell your narrative about your contributions. This course will help you recognize, create, and use these innovation narratives.

### Required instructional materials

#### Textbook(s)

There is no textbook for this course.

However, this course requires a wide variety of reading; I will supply either links to or reproductions of any material assigned.

#### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com), and [Slack](https://cmpsc-480-00-fa-2020.slack.com) platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

#### Media

Before each week begins, I will assign reading(s) and a group of short, topic-focused videos to review. These readings and videos may contain activities that you can do in parallel with or after reading and watching material. Video content is meant to support, but not substitute for, topics discussed and exercised that week. I will provide links to participate in or to access activities or supplmentary material in a Slack post along with video links.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

* Develop tools and skills to understand and relay your identity as a developer
* Create an online web presence which showcases that professional identity and the work which supports it
* Learn how to contribute to the on-going professional conversation about software development
* Understand industry standards, best practices, and ethics
* Begin the process of planning next steps toward opportunities in which you're interested

### Grading

|Category           |Percentage |Point value|
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
|Participation      |10%        |100 pts.   |
|Assignments        |60%        |600 pts.   |
|Final project      |30%        |300 pts.   |
|                   |           |           |
|Total              |100%       |1000 pts.  |

#### Class participation

Participation serves as one of the main vehicles for success in a class like this. The term "participation" means _actively engaging with and sincerely attempting completion of class activities_, of which there may be multiple in a given week. Due dates for class activties will be given at the time of assignment along with activity guidelines. In some cases (especially in the opening weeks of the course), completing activities is crucial to being able to progress in the class. 

I also write this with full awareness that the remote nature of this course complicates what one might assume the word "presence" to mean. Here, you should understand the word to indicate that I expect you to participate in sessions with the group to which you are assigned. Given the highly-distributed nature of our class, the times that group sessions are held will vary according to availability of all of the members.

In addition, I expect that activities and/or worksheets given during these sessions will be completed by the deadlines indicated on materials distributed during the session. These due dates/times will be flexible enough to allow students to complete work at a reasonable pace.

Because this class is a group-based course, a large part of your Participation grade will be the creation and filing of session-by-session group reports for your group's work. These reports are meant to be short summaries of group activity and will be included as part of your assignment sheets.

These activities are the main mechanic I use to assign participation grades.

###### Recorded content

I will record all common class content.

* You have the right to turn off your camera and/or audio input
* You have the right to choose not to be present
* You have the right to choose to watch recorded materials later

I ask that, if you are unable to watch or attend live sessions, you reach out to me so that we can advantage you with the resources you need for this course (including scheduling a regular office-hour check in).

#### Assignments

Each week will feature either new or ongoing assignments. These assignments play a crucial role in planning and developing various components of the course-culminating [Web project](#web-project). Subjects for these assignments will range from personal skills inventories to participating in software review sessions. All assignments create opportunities to strengthen the ways that students interact with and present themselves to others in the software development discipline. The amount of points for each assignment is progressive, and reflects the diffculty inherent in the tasks required.

#### Web Project

The final course assignment brings together various components created during the semester's assignments. While some assignments will feature tangible products (e.g. code, site copy, et al.) others may be more ambiguous, but no less influential in nature (e.g. personal narrative work, content structures, et al.). The final product, the web site, should function as both a résumé and portfolio, but feature its various components in a manner consistent with the professional identity intended.

##### Due dates

Students may turn assignments in up to one (1) week late, though a 15% penalty applies to the final grade. In order to satisfy this condition, late assignments must be turned in no later than exactly one (1) week after the original deadline. Failure to meet the extended late assignment window will cause students to receive a zero (0)% for the given assignment.

The final assignment, the Web Project, is not eligible for this extension.

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a schedule with assignments and will accompany all videos with a copy of the slides presented.

#### Preparation for office hours

To make the most of our time during office hours, _you must post a minimum of `1` and a maximum of `3` questions in our office ours appointment comment box (as seen on the [office hours calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUZhdGE0ampEVWhHfGRlZmF1bHR8MDAxZDc2Yjg3NTFhMjMwMjM4OWM5ZjE5ZmU5YTI4ODk&pli=1)). Failure to do so will make our discussions less productive and will make addressing your questions more difficult.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the instructor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. Part of my role as a course instructor is to make sure that students receive the assistant they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work.
